There are 13 python files in the code folder. Each file name specifies what random optimization algorithm is used for which problem. 

We have four RO algorithms:
	hc: Hill Climbing
	sa: Simulated Annealing
	ga: Genetic Algorithm
	mimic: Mutual-Information-Maximizing Input Clustering

and three problems chosen by myself:
	tsp: Traveling Salesman Problem
	fx: Multiple Optimum Problem
	single_optima: Single Optima Problem

The code for neural network weight optimization problem is written in neural.py. The dataset for this classification is titanic.csv

Before running the code, make sure that code files and data files are placed into the same folder. Then you can open the terminal, navigate to that folder and execute "py XXX.py". (Make sure that you have installed all the packages if necessary)

£¡£¡£¡  For the neural network weight optimization problem and mimic algorithm, I made use of the python package mlrose. However, I have made some modifications to the source code to facilitate my analysis. Therefore, I have included a copy of my mlrose package. And if you want to run my code, make sure that after you install mlrose, replace the installed package by my own version of mlrose folder.
