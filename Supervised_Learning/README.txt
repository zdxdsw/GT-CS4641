There are two code folders and two data folders for two classification problems separately (letter recognition and titanic). Each data folder contains a training set and a testing set. Each code folder contains five .py files for five ML algorithms. All codes are written in Python.

Before running the code, make sure that code files and data files of the same classification problem are placed into the same folder. Then you can open the terminal, navigate to that folder and execute "py XXX.py". (Make sure that you have installed all the packages if necessary)

Note that execution of certain programs will generate new files. For the Titanic problem, execution of each program will generate a "submission.csv" file, which records the predictions made by the resulting ML model on the testing set. This is because this problem is from Kaggle competition and I need to submit the prediction results to Kaggle website to see the testing score. Furthermore, since Kaggle does not provide ground truth for the testing dataset, the only way to know testing scores is to submit results and let the website calculate it. It might be a little bit troublesome to reproduce results, so I have included the screenshots of my submissions from Kaggle website in "Kaggle-submissions-screenshot.doc" file in case it is needed.
